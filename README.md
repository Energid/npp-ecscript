EcScript Highlighting for Notepad++
===================================

If you are an Actin EcScript user who uses Notepad++ for editing scripts, 
then this plugin is for you.

It provides nice syntax coloring and indenting for EcScript files, and also
registers the .ecs and .ecscript file extensions so Notepad++ can autodetect
your scripts.

Installation
------------

Open the User Defined Language dialog in Notepad++ using the "Language ==> User
Defined Language ==> Defined your language..." menu. In this dialog, click on
the "Import..." button and, in the Open dialog that appears, select the
'EcScriptUDL.xml' file from your cloned copy of this repository. Click on the
"Open" button to close the Open dialog. Click on the X in the top-right corner
of the User Defined Language dialog to close it.
